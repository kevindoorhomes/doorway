## Summary of Job Functions

##### Client Managers:

The client managers are in charge of the creation and management of all leads. The CMs must be organized and diligent in logging tasks and touching base with each lead accordingly. It is their job to see the lead process through from start to finish, with the end being the conversion of a lead into an opportunity and a reassignment of that lead to another Door agent.

The CMs also oversee the Task Management Process throughout the office. This includes making sure that each agent is current on their tasks and is filling out ProsperWorks fields accordingly.

##### Field Agents:

The field agents are often the first Door face that a client meets. They are boots-to-the-ground, out in the field, winning over potential clients. Their main role is to attend listing presentations as they educate interested sellers on just how awesome Door is. The listing presentation is Door's way of first impressing a client with all we have to offer. They use their knowledge of the real estate market as they guide prospects through the seller portal and help them settle on a value for their home. 

Once they leave a presentation, they are diligent about following up with clients until they are ready to sign their Listing Agreement.
