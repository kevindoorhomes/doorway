# Field Agent

Field Agent's primary role is to attend Listing Presentations and win business for Door. Once a client has agreed to work with Door, the Field Agent sends a Listing Agreement via the Team Lead's ZipForm. Once this is signed, our Transaction Coordinator with Onboarding is looped in to begin the scheduling processes.
