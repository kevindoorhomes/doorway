During a listing presentation, the field agent will tour the house and present a slidedeck created specifically for that house. The slidedeck will include the following information:

* High level overview of what Door is and the services provided
* How door will list and market a home
* How door will stage and photography a home
* Explanation of how Door handles showing requests
* Competitive market analysis of the clients home that was generated by the valuation team
* Show comparable houses in the subdivision and current market trends
* Summary of the recommended selling price and money saved if the client decided to use Door

After a listing presentation has been completed, the field agent will continue to follow up with the client until there is a mutual agreement to sign a listing agreement. The field agent will then use ZipForm to send an electronic listing agreement to the client. Once this agreement has been signed, the process will continue to the [onboarding team](/transaction-coordinator/onboarding.md).
