# Breaking down the One-to-Four Family Residential Contract

The contracts that make up a real estate transaction are long and wordy, but it is your duty as a licensed agent to be familiar with, and able to explain, all parts of the document. If you are ever unsure about the meaning of a paragraph or two of the contract, seek advice from your colleagues, broker, your company's attorney, or professionals in the title industry - to name a few.

In this section, you will find a few paragraphs broken down. We will be looking at some of the critical details of the contract that are the most important to clients as they negotiate offers.

&lt;keep this???&gt;**Paragraph 1 **

Paragraph 1 names the parties to the contract. Be sure to double check with your clients to confirm their legal names. If there have been recent marital changes, confirm who all needs to be named on the contract. ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-01-16 at 7.54.23 PM.png)

&lt;keep this???&gt;**Paragraph 2.A**

Paragraph 2.A gives the legal description of the property. Always double check this for accuracy. ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-01-16 at 8.00.50 PM.png)

**Paragraph 2.D**

Paragraph 2.D of the contract excludes improvements and accessories from the sale. If your clients are retaining a specific light fixture, attached TV mount, window coverings, etc, it will be named here. At Door, we have our seller's fill out an exclusions page that includes anything they are going to retain after the sale of the home.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-01-16 at 8.02.33 PM.png)

**Paragraph 3**

Paragraph 3 is where the buyers present their offer amount. This is probably the first detail that a client wants to know. It is made up of three parts:

* Paragraph 3.A - The down payment 
* Paragraph 3.B - The amount that is being financed and where they are obtaining the financing 
  * Third Party Financing Addendum \(most common\), Loan Assumption Addendum, Seller Financing Addendum
* Paragraph 3.C - The total offer amount. A+B=C
* If A matches C, and nothing is being financed, your buyer is presenting a cash offer.

**Paragraph 5**

Paragraph 5 states the amount of earnest money the buyer will place in escrow and which title company will handle the transaction.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-01-16 at 8.15.17 PM.png)

**Paragraph 6.A**

Paragraph 6.A establishes who will pay for the title policy. Depending on the price of the home, this policy can be thousands of dollars. This is typically a seller's expense, but if a buyer offers to pay for the title policy, it can effect how much the seller will net at closing. ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-01-16 at 8.16.59 PM.png)

**Paragraph 6.C**

Paragraph 6.C outlines which party is responsible for delivering a survey and the timeline in which it is to be delivered. If your seller doesn't have an existing survey, paying attention to this paragraph can save them a few hundred dollars. If the sellers have a survey, but have since added a pool or structure to the land, you can check box 1. Since the survey is not acceptable, check "Buyer's expense" at the bottom of the paragraph, and the buyer will be responsible for purchasing the new survey.
