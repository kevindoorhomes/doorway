# When Your Listing Is Active

A big part of your role as a listing agent is client relations while a listing is live.

Many of the day to day activities of a listing agent come from client communication and management of an active listing. Please reference the [Daily Activities - Sell ](/listing-agent/daily-activities.md)section for more detailed information about important listing management tasks.

Below you will find some simpler processes that may come up while a property is listed on the MLS.

**Implementing a Price Improvement**

Our Field Agents and valuation team are rock stars when it comes to assessing a home's value. However, real estate is an ever changing market, and sometimes lowering the price of a listing will place it in a better position in the market.

For more detailed information on how to have a conversation about a price improvement with a client, visit the "Implementing a Price Improvement" page.

* A price improvement should never be implemented until after the [TAR Amendment to Listing](http://www.sarealtywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/230/2015/10/TX-Amendment-to-Listing-TAR-1404.pdf) agreement is signed.
* Speak with your client early on about the possibility of a price improvement. 
* Set expectations about how you will watch the market and advise them based on current market conditions. 
* Use comparable properties and [Quick CMA](/listing-agent/daily-activities.md)s from the MLS to guide your clients pricing decisions.

Send an email update through CSS and use information from the CSS showing report to contact any agent that had shown interest in the property.

**Extending the terms of Listing Agreement**

Sometimes, there are those properties that just don't sell as quickly as anticipated. In this instance, it is encouraged to speak with your client about extending the terms of their listing agreement. If they agree, extend the expiration date of the Listing Agreement to the agreed upon date using the [TAR Amendment to Listing](http://www.sarealtywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/230/2015/10/TX-Amendment-to-Listing-TAR-1404.pdf) form.

If a client does not want to extend the listing agreement, then the listing will expire on the previously agreed upon date.

**Logging Listing Amendments**
