# When Your Listing Is Active

A big part of your role as a listing agent is client relations while a listing is live.

Many of the day to day activities of a listing agent come from client communication and management of an active listing. Please reference the Daily Activities section for more detailed information about important listing management tasks. 

Below you will find some simpler processes that may come up while a property is listed on the MLS. 

**Implementing a Price Improvement**

Our Field Agents and valuation team are rock stars when it comes to assessing a home's value. However, real estate is an ever changing market, and sometimes lowering the price of a listing will place it in a better position in the market. 

* A price improvement should never be implemented until after the [TAR Amendment to Listing](http://www.sarealtywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/230/2015/10/TX-Amendment-to-Listing-TAR-1404.pdf) agreement is signed.
