# Implementing a Price Improvement

**Goal: **The goal of this conversation is to have the client sign a price change amendment. A price improvement is a critical mechanism for increasing interest in a home and ensuring that the top-of-market price at which the market allows for a transaction to occur is reached. Sellers are frequently resistant to dropping the price and a Door Agent must help them understand why it is necessary to do so.

### The Framework for the Conversation

##### Communicate Door's Value

* Value delivered since the last pricing event \(i.e. going live or price drop\) is **FAB**
  * **F**eedback we’ve gotten
    * Actual agents we’ve contacted, and their feedback if received
  * **A**gents we have sent your home to who have shown it to their clients
    * MLS views and actual showings
    * The most well-qualified buyers looking to buy in your submarket
  * **B**uyers to whom we have pushed your home \(online views\)

##### Deliver Actual Data

* Showing rates in the local submarket
  * CSS data on how many showings comparable properties have seen recently
* Comparable sales
  * The most recent comparable sales and how they differ from this one...
* Comparable active properties are not selling because...
  * E.g.: price per square foot, year of construction, size, beds/baths, etc.

##### No Offers or Showings

* We have received no offers\(or showings\) since the last pricing event
  * This is a clear indication that the price is too high
* We are in danger of languishing on the market, or:
* We are in danger of missing the selling season
  * This argument is easily used toward the end of the summer months/early fall
* We are in danger of being outpriced by other homes
  * This argument can be used in late January/early February as more inventory entering the market is likely in the spring and summer.
* Serious buyers are in the market but they will move on
* Being priced higher than your neighbors, is only helping sell your neighbors’ homes.
* No showings indicates that we are not priced for today’s market
* No offers after 10 showings, means that we are missing the mark on pricing.

##### Closing

* Here’s the price we suggest
* Remember x people have viewed the home in the past x weeks and we have no offer
* In a market such as this, our formula is typically 10 showings and no offer indicates that we are not priced for today’s market.
* “If I send you a price change amendment today, are you okay with signing that so that we can improve the price, make sure your home doesn’t languish on the market, and sell your home?”

### Common Objections to a Price Improvement

##### You’re not doing enough to market my home.

* Door has gotten your home in front of X number of buyers. X number of agents have shown the home to actively looking and well-qualified buyers because of our efforts.
* X number of showings have taken place versus a market average of Y.
* Zillow view information. Agent feedback contacts made.

##### My neighbor’s home just sold.

* That home is different because of \(e.g.\) square footage, price per square foot, age, etc.
* That home had been on the market for X days prior to selling. Longer than our DOM.
* We effectively helped to sell your neighbor’s home since we are priced too high and they were priced for today’s market.

##### What about an open house?

* We have sold over $100M in homes and not one has sold due to open houses.
* We're not going to waste your time and put your property at risk with open houses.
* Liability for open houses is on you, the homeowner, for property theft, etc., per the standard listing agreement published by the Texas Association of Realtors.
* Open houses are a holdover from the days before we had technology to market a property. We believe in marketing your home to the most qualified buyers utilizing today’s technology.

##### But my house has unique features.

* What are the features of your home that we are not incorporating into the listing?
  * What are they? Email them to us.
* Yes, but we are priced such that we are competing with new construction/rehabs.
* A pool does not add value because some buyers want one, but many do not.

##### We just need to find the right buyer.

* The right buyer is out there and has likely seen the home already.
* Since the last pricing event, Door has gotten your home in front of X number of buyers. X number of agents have shown the home to their qualified buyers because of our efforts. X number of showings have taken place. Still, we have not seen an offer.

##### This home needs the attention of a more traditional agent.

* Door wins for the past month: X houses sold, X volume sold.
* Of course a traditional agent would tell you they can sell your home better. What else would you expect them to say?
* Every time a client has asked to cancel their agreement or has moved on to another brokerage their home has sold for less than the last price at which they were listed with Door. Every. Single. Case.
