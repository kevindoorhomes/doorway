# Negotiation

Congrats! You just got an offer on your listing. Now what?

ALL offers must be presented to clients in a timely manner. Unless your client requests to view all offers at a specific time, do everything you can to present offers shortly after they are received.

Communicate with buyers' agents to let them know that you received the offer and when you will be presenting it.

**To present an offer: **

Use the [Door](https://doorhomes.com/) Seller's Portal to present offers to your clients. Login using your @doorhomes.com email and access the Admin Portal.

Search for your listing and click on the offer tab at the top.

Fill out all critical details and attach offer documents. For more detail information about where this information comes from, see our contract break down.

Use the Door [Affiliated Business Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b_ySv2TqJA-FsmGTyHMCeRXycOiOm0qDGS8pcuXWHrI/edit?usp=sharing) to help you estimate the title fees. 

Use the Realist Tax application from [NTREIS ](https://idp.ntreis.safemls.net/idp/Authn/UserPassword)to estimate taxes and their loan payment. This [amortization calculator](http://www.amortization-calc.com/) is a huge help with that!

**File the Offer in DropBox.**

Rename the file to match the following naming conventions: Offer - B Buyer - 123 Main St, 75201

File in DropBox: Active &gt; 123 Main St, 75201 &gt; Negotiation &gt;Buyer 1 \(change buyer name, ie: B Buyer\).

**Send the Door Affiliated Business Agreement \(ABA\) Disclosure via email to the potential buyer along with the counter offer or executed contract.**

**If multiple offers are received, follow the same steps for each buyer. Rename the DropBox buyer folders to reflect the names of the different potential buyers.**

Discuss an offer deadline with your clients. It is recommended send out an email in CSS to notify all agents that there are multiple offers on the property.

From here, you and your clients will either negotiate one offer, or decide between the multiple offers received. Time to execute a contract and move on to the [Active Option ](/listing-agent/process-guide/active-option.md)stage.
