# Negotiation

Congrats! You just got an offer on your listing. Now what?

ALL offers must be presented to clients in a timely manner. Unless your client requests to view all offers at a specific time, do everything you can to present offers shortly after they are received.

Communicate with buyers' agents to let them know that you received the offer and when you will be presenting it.

**To present an offer: **

Use the [Door](https://doorhomes.com/) Seller's Portal to present offers to your clients. Login using your @doorhomes.com email and access the Admin Portal.
