Subject: Next Steps \| 123 Main St, 75201

> Hi ,
>
> Congrats again on your executed contract! I've attached a copy for your records.
>
> I've listed some action items that will need your attention below, as well as an explanation of some of the next steps we will be taking:
>
> **SURVEY **- If we do not already have a copy of your existing survey, please forward to us ASAP. In the event you do not have one, we can order one through title, just let me know. We will also need the attached T-47 affidavit to accompany your existing survey. Please fill it out, have it notarized, and returned to me at your earliest convenience.
>
> **OPTION PERIOD **- Your option period began upon execution of the contract and will end on INSERT DATE at 5pm. The buyer will schedule an inspection of the property through CSS so you will be able to approve accordingly. These are typically 3-4 hours long and you do not need to be present at the time of inspection. Once the inspection has been completed and the buyer has received the report from the inspector, they will typically prepare a repair amendment and we will review this together. Once both parties \(you and the buyers\) have agreed on any proposed repairs, we will move forward into a pending status.
>
> **TITLE WORK - **I have forwarded a copy of your contract to INSERT ESROW OFFICER NAME AND COMPANY. They will be reaching out soon for some additional information from you. Please return any requested documents to them in a timely manner as any delays could eventually delay closing. You can reach INSERT NAME at INSERT PHONE NUMBER if you have any questions.
>
> **APPRAISAL** - This will be ordered through CSS by the buyer's lender sometime after the option period has ended. You will not need to be present for this. This is to determine the appraised value of the home. If the appraisal happens to come back lower than the contract price, we may have to do a little more negotiating.
>
> **APPOINTMENTS THROUGH CSS **- The appointments scheduled through CSS should slow down at this point. Appointments to be on the lookout for in the coming days are the inspection and the appraisal. Buyers may schedule additional appointments to take measurements, get quotes for any work they are having done, and finally, to do their final walk through before closing.
>
> I'm excited to help you through the rest of this process! If you have any questions at all, please reach out.

> Best,

**Receipt the Option Fee**

It is the buyer's agent's responsibility to be sure the option fee is delivered to the seller or the buyer's agent within 3 days of getting the contract executed. 

There are a few ways this can happen:

* The buyer's agent delivers the option fee to the office
* The buyer's agent delivers the option fee to the seller's home.
  * If this is the method of delivery, ask the agent AND your sellers to send a picture of the check to confirm it was delivered.
* Buyer's agent delievers the option fee to title.
  * If this happens, title will need to get the check to you within the 3 day time period. 
* The title company can send a FedEx label to the buyer's agent to over night these checks to their office, if needed.

A title company can arrange a courier to be used to collect and deliver these checks, however, this is the most costly method of delivery. 

It is best practice to do your best to accomodate the buyer's agent to help facilitate the option fee being delivered on time.

To receipt the option fee, fill out page 9 of the contract. Use the screen grab below as a reference.

**Negotiate Repairs**

During the option period, the buyers and their agent will schedule an inspection through CSS. Typically, an amendment to the contract asking for repairs will be sent to you. You will negotiate with the buyer's agent until repairs have been agreed upon. Pay special attention to the wording for repairs, beacuse your sellers will be held to complete repairs as stated in the contract. Be sure requests are specific action items.

Paragraph 7 of the [amendment](https://www.trec.texas.gov/forms/amendment) will end the option period early if you agree upon repairs before the original expiration date. You should check this box when you send back the amendment for final signatures.
