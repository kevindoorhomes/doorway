# Onboarding Your Listing

Our Transaction Coordinators do most of the MLS input. As the Listing Agent, you will need to complete a few tasks before setting the listing to Active.

**Write the Property Description: **

The property description is the blurb that goes into the MLS and onto real estate websites like Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com. When writing the property description there are a few things to be careful of.

* Make sure the information about the home is accurate. Cross reference the seller's residential **`input form`**. 
* It is crown moulding - not molding.
* There should never be more than 1 exclamation point after a sentence!~~!!! ~~
* Only proper nouns should be capitalized
* If a Seller instructs us to put "motivated seller," "bring all offers," "seller must move," or anything to that effect, those comments should be put in Private Remarks in the MLS. These comments should never go in the public description.

**Double check the MLS information**

Our onboarding team is good, but always double check the information that is entered into the MLS on your behalf. The listing is under your license number, so it is your responsibility to assure all information is accurate.

Pay special attention to the sales price. It is crucial to list the home with the correct price from the beginning. 

Once the listing is correctly input into the MLS...

**Change the listing status to Active. **

&lt;Screen grab&gt;

**Move the Opportunity to the Marketing stage in ProsperWorks.**

&lt;screen grab&gt;

Enter the listing live date and add the MLS number in the opportunity.

&lt;screen grab&gt;

**Update the \#retargetting thread in Slack.**

Use the following format: 123 Main St. is live

&lt;screen grab&gt;

**Move the property's folder in DropBox from the "Listing Presentation" folder to the "Active" folder.**

&lt;screen grab&gt;

**Send "Your Listing is Live" canned response.**

Subject: Your Listing is Live \| 123 Main St

> Hi \_ !
>
> I wanted to let you know thatÂ your listing isÂ live on the MLS! It may take an hour or two before it's been pushed out to Zillow, Trulia, etc. 
>
> Buyer's agents can now schedule viewings through the Centralized Showing Service. You will get a notification every time an agent schedules a showing. I've set it up as "appointment only" with a minimum 1-hour notice so that you can approve/deny each request. If you do need to deny, all I ask is that you let me know a general reason so I can notify the agent that it just isn't a good time but that the home is still available. 
>
> As you already know, I'll be you Listing Agent, watching the market and negotiating on your behalf until close. Any questions about contracts, offers, etc., may be directed towards me.
>
> Looking forward to continuing to work with you!

> Best,
