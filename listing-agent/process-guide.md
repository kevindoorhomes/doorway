The Field Agents attend **Listing Presentations **to win a listing. Once a client has agreed to list with Door, they sign a **Listing Agreement**. Once the Listing Agreement is signed, an opportunity is sent to **Onboarding**. Here, our transaction coordinators collect forms and scheduled staging and photography appointments. Once the photographs are processed and the property description has been written, it is time to set the **Listing Live**. Now that the listing is live, it is the **Marketing stage**. You will start getting showings on your listings and spednd time communicating with clients. If a buyer submits an offer, you will enter into **Negotiations.** After terms have been agreed upon and a contract has been executed, your listing will be in the **Active Option **stage. Here, the buyers will conduct an inspection and often times ask for repairs. Upon the option period expiration date, your listing is **Pending**. During the pending stage and with the help from the title company, you help to eduacte and prepare your clients for closing. Upon signing the closing documents and funding of a property, it is officially **CLOSED**! Congrats!
