# Daily Tasks for a Door Listing Agent

Door is structured so that the listing agents are primarily in the office responding to clients, agents, and other parties involved in a real estate transaction. Much of our time is spent communicating with clients and negotiating offers. This section outlines ways in which listing agents communicate with clients, and manage other tasks throughout the week.

### **Weekly Client Calls**

It is Door policy to touch base with clients 2 times each week,  with at least one of those touch points being a phone call. Of course, the amount of calls made to a client can easily increase depending on what stage of the transaction they are in.

* **Onboarding** - Many calls during the onboarding stage will be to follow up about forms, answer client questions before going live, and to confirm any information in the MLS or on the property description. 
* **Marketing** - Communication during marketing deserves a section all its own, and will be revisited later.
* **Active Option** - During the active option period, you will be communicating with your client heavily about repairs and confirming documents are being delivered by the date specified in the contract. 
* **Pending** - Communication during the pending stage will be to discuss appraisals and schedule closing. Proactive communiaction during the pending stage will reassure clients their agents are on top of dates and documents as closing approaches. Put some extra effort into making sure your clients are aware of the work you are doing behind the scenes. This may be cc'ing them on an email to title to get closing scheduled, or sending a text letting them know you've reviewed the contract making sure nothing needs to be amended.

**Calls during the Marketing Stage**

When a listing is newly on the market, the primary client communication will be about feedback received from other agents. Use the [Centralized Showing Service](https://app.showings.com/Login) \(CSS\) website to track who has viewed the listing and the feedback received. If an agent doesn't provide any feedback, it is best practice to call them to get feedback for the seller.

In CSS, click on the Showing Report tab to access a log of showings for all listings.

In the showing report, the reports can be "open" or "collapsed" depending on personal preference when viewing. The date range can also be altered to change how far back the report pulls from.

After your listing has been active for a week, weekly updates will be available under the property address in DropBox. Onboarding prepares these for the listing agents. Each week a Property Report and a Showing Report will be prepared. These documents are used to inform clients of how their property is performing online, and can help agents as they encourage price improvements down the line.

Send a "Weekly Updates" email using the following canned response, or one similar. This may need to be edited depending on how the weekly update information will be used.

Once a listing has been on the market or has received negative feedback about the price, it will be time to revisit the original value and implement a price improvement.
