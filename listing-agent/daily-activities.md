# Daily Tasks for a Door Listing Agent

**Goal: **Keep clients up to date on the status of their listing and maintain a transparent log of communication to insure

Door is structured so that the listing agents are primarily in the office responding to clients, agents, and other parties involved in a real estate transaction. Much of our time is spent communicating with clients and negotiating offers. This section outlines ways in which listing agents communicate with clients, and manage other tasks throughout the week.

### **Weekly Client Communication**

Door’s product is a methodical and professional style of communication as much as it is a technology-enabled real estate transaction platform. It is of paramount importance that Door’s Sellers receive a continuous flow of informative information from their Door Agent.

* **Onboarding** - Many calls during the onboarding stage will be to answer client questions before going live and to confirm any information in the MLS or on the property description. 
* **Setting the Listing Live** - send an email congratulating the client on their listing going live. Notify them that within a couple hours the listing will be pushed out to Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com and about 90 other sites. See canned response in [Onboarding-Sell.](/listing-agent/process-guide/listing-live.md)
* **Marketing** - Communication during marketing deserves a section all its own, and will be revisited later.
* **Active Option** - During the active option period, you will be communicating with your client heavily about repairs and confirming documents are being delivered by the date specified in the contract. 
* **Pending** - Communication during the pending stage will be to discuss appraisals and schedule closing. Proactive communiaction during the pending stage will reassure clients their agents are on top of dates and documents as closing approaches. Put some extra effort into making sure your clients are aware of the work you are doing behind the scenes. This may be cc'ing them on an email to title to get closing scheduled, or sending a text letting them know you've reviewed the contract making sure nothing needs to be amended.

### **Calls during the Marketing Stage**

**Agent Feedback**

When a listing is newly on the market, the primary client communication will be about feedback received from other agents. Use the [Centralized Showing Service](https://app.showings.com/Login) \(CSS\) website to track who has viewed the listing and the feedback received. If an agent doesn't provide any feedback, it is best practice to call them to get feedback for the seller. Typically, feedback is only received 20-30% of the time. Make it a habit to call agents and take notes on their feedback.

In CSS, click on the Showing Report tab to access a log of showings for all listings.

In the showing report, the reports can be "open" or "collapsed" depending on personal preference when viewing. The date range can also be altered to change how far back the report pulls from.

**Weekly Updates**

After the listing has been active for a week, weekly updates will be available under the property address in DropBox. Onboarding prepares these for the listing agents. Each week a Property Report will be prepared. These documents are used to inform clients of how their property is performing online, and can help agents as they encourage price improvements down the line.

Send a "Weekly Updates" email using the following canned response, or one similar. This may need to be edited depending on how the weekly update information will be used.

Subject: Weekly Updates \| 123 Main St, 75201

> Hi !
>
> I've pulled together our showing report for this week as well as some information regarding how well our property has been performing online. Take a look at the attached, and let me know if you have any questions! Do you have time to hop on a call later today or tomorrow to discuss?

> Best,

**Price Improvements**

Once a listing has been on the market for a few weeks with little to no traffic/offers or has received negative feedback about the price, it will be time to revisit the original value and implement a price improvement. Visit the[ "Implementing a Price Improvement](/listing-agent/process-guide/marketing/implementing-a-price-improvement.md)" page for more detailed information about how this conversation looks.

### Logging in ProsperWorks

Logging calls, notes and other activities in ProsperWorks is important for many reasons.

### DropBox and ProsperWorks Maintenance

Logging communication and notes in ProsperWorks and filing documents correctly in DropBox are an important part of listing agents' job. Days get busy, and often times agents are handling multiple transactions at a time. If an agent doesn't have time to update ProsperWorks or file a document right away, it is important that they take time for data managment throughout the week. Take time each week to look through your Opportunities and DropBox to make sure all dates and files are up-to-date and correctly named.

See the [Naming Conventions](/misc/naming-conventions.md) page for a detailed list of exactly how a document should be filed.
