# Onboarding

Our Onboarding team is responsible for getting listings ready to go live. They start their work on a transaction once we have a signed Listing Agreement in place. Some of their tasks include:

* Scheduling staging
* Scheduling photography
* Inputting a listing into the MLS
* Setting up the listing through CSS
* Sending CDAs on behalf of the agents
