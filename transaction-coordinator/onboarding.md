# Onboarding

Our Onboarding team assists both the sell and buy side. On the buy side, once the deal is at the closing table, the transaction recorder will send a commission dispersement agreement to the title and lender company. 

On the sell side, the transaction recorder will begin the process once the field agent has successfully obtained a listing agreement from the client. The transaction recorder will ask the seller for the following documents during onboarding:

* Inspections
* Surveys
* Residential input form
* Sellers disclosure
* Exclusions list
* Lead based paint addendum

After all the forms have been sent, a link to the seller's portal will be emailed to the seller so that they can choose an optimum time to schedule a staging. 

Once the time has been chosen and any showing restrictions disclosed, the transaction coordinator will reach out to the Door vendors and choose a stager and photographer for the time determined on the seller's portal.

Within 24 hours, the pictures and Matterport 3D scan will have been completed. The transaction recorder is now able to add the listing on MLS with the appropriate information and drop the lockbox and sign off at the house.

This is the end of the transaction recorders responsibility for a specific listing.

Another item that needs to be handled by the transaction recorder is the weekly update for the listing agents. These often consists of property reports, which show important information such as views.
