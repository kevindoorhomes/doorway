## Buyers Agent

Just notes, will process later.

Buyers agents will receive most their leads from the CM. At this point the lead should be pre-qualified and already signed up for a showing request. The buyers agent will meet the potential client for the first time at the showing.

Sometimes, a previous client will provide a referral, in which the buyers agent must then open communications via either phone or email with the referral prior to meeting.

At the showing, the buyers agent align goals and go over with them what Door does. \(There's a document that Matt sent me that has all the commonly asked questions him and Jackson have received in the past\).

If the client decides that they like the house that they were shown, then the buyers agent will reach out to the listing agent and gather information.

During this conversation with a listing agent be sure to extract as much information as you can.

Here are some things you will want to gather from the listing agent:

* Ask if there are any offers on the house currently, and if so what are they?
* If there are any inspection documents available on the house?
* If the house had been under contract in the past and the status has changed, ask why?
* Just general information about the house.

After gathering all the information you needed from the listing agent, the buyers agent will pull comps and call the client. The conversation with the client will answer and question the client had about the house as well as going over the information gathered from the listing agent. If the client is still interested, then discuss with the client on what they wish to offer.

The offer will consist of several components:

* Offer price
* Earnest money
* Closing time
* Residential service \(small amount of payment commonly used 
* Active option contract price

After the phone call, draft the offer letter and send it to the client using ZipForms, at the same time send over the buyer representation agreement which gives the buyers agent the exclusive rights to represent the client.The buyer representation agreement is typically for a 6 month period. Do not continue until the client has signed the buyer representation agreement.

Once the form has been signed, send the offer to the listing agent. If the offer is accepted, then the process will now move into the active option contract period which is a duration of around 7-10 days. During this period, conduct and inspections that need to be completed. If there are any major repairs that need to be done, an addendum can be made to negotiate the repair costs. Be careful about the addendum, since there is a possibility of a backup offer in which there is no addendum. 

After active option contract the process can then either go to pending which is dependent on such things as finance contigency or it could go to active contigent. There are different levels of contingency. An example of a reason for active contingency is if someone needs to sell their house first before they have enough capital to purchase anohter home. Active Contingent is not a good position to be in, because if the seller receives another offer without contingency they can notify the person whose offer is in first position \(current offer\) and ask them if they would like to remove contingency or keep it and let the seller decide on what to do.

If the process proceeds to pending, at this point most homes close pending qualification from the lender. Once the client has been qualified, the process will go to the closing table where the deal is done. Door onboarding will be sending a commission dispersement agreement, which is a document telling the title and lender company, that although Door is taking the 3% buyers fee, they will disperse the remaining amount over $5000 back to the client. 

The job of the buyers agent is mostly done at this point. The buyers agent will still be a point of contact, but there is no additional work to be done.
