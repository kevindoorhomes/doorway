## Buyers Agent

Just notes, will process later.

Buyers agents will receive their leads from the CM. At this point the lead should be qualified and signed up for a showing request. The buyers agent will reach out to the potential buyer to align goals and go over with them what Door does. \(There's a document that Matt sent me that has all the commonly asked questions him and Jackson have received in the past\). After the client has decided on a house to look at, pull very quick comps and have a conversation with the listing agent.

During this conversation with a listing agent be sure to extract as much information as you can.

Here are some things you will want to gather from the listing agent:

* Ask if there are any offers on the house currently, and if so what are they?
* If there are any inspection documents available on the house?
* If the house had been under contract in the past and the status has changed, ask why?
* Just general information
