## What is Google Authenticator?

Google Authenticator generates 2-Step Verification codes on your phone.

2-Step Verification provides stronger security for your Google Account by requiring a second step of verification when you sign in. In addition to your password, youâ€™ll also need a code generated by the Google Authenticator app on your phone.

## How do we use Google Authenticator here at Door?

For the most secure apps we require that a 2-step authenticator be used to.
