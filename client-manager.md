# Client Managers

The client managers are in charge of the creation and management of all leads. The CMs must be organized and diligent in logging tasks and touching base with each lead accordingly. It is their job to see the lead process through from start to finish, with the end being the conversion of a lead into an opportunity and a reassignment of that lead to another Door agent.
