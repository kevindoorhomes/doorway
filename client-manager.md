## Client Managers

Client managers will field all inquiries to Door and manage the entire lead process. These inquiries will come from such sources as intercom \(the chatbox on the Door website\), KnockKnock \(contact email on the Door website\), phone calls, and listing presentation requests generated from the web form on the Door site.

Depending on whether the inquiry is for a buyer or seller, there is a separate process for each. As shown in the high level client manager overview diagram below.

Whenever, a client manager recieves an inquiry that is not a listing presentation request, it is their responsibility to follow-up and gather as much information as possible about the potential client which includes email addresses, phone number, and whether they are pre-qualified for a loan. Once the client manager has cleared the client, they will enter the inquiry as a lead in Prosperworks. It is at this time that the lead will be classified as a buy or sell lead. Each lead will have a different team assigned to them depending on the physical location of the property in the region.

Below is a sample regional map for the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, please refer to your local regional territory map. There is a separate team \(listing and field agent\) that service the blue regions and the orange regions.

If the client fills out a listing request form on the Door webpage, the client manager will go directly to scheduling a listing presentation.
