## Client Manager: Buy Side

Once you've created a buy side lead and assigned the corresponding buyers team to the lead, follow up with the client until they've either agreed to showing request or declined our services. At this point, the client manager job is done. If a showing is requested, the buyers agents will continue the rest of the process.
