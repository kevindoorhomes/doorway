## Client Manager: Sell Side

Once you've created a sell side lead and assigned the corresponding listing agent team to the lead, follow up with the client until they've either agreed to scheduled listing presentation or declined our services. Once a listing presentation has been scheduled, the client manager will reach out to the valuation team to generate a CMA and move the lead in Prosperworks to LP Scheduled so that the field agents can continue the next step of the process.
